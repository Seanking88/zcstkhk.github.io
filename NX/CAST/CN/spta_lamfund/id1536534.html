         <h2>Defining plies and a stacking sequence</h2>
         
         <p align="center"><img align="bottom" src="../graphics/graphicLibrary/nx_dss/adv_sim/laminates/lam_physical_property/ply_layup_icons.gif"></p>
         
         <p>For both zone-based and ply-based processes, you create plies and define the stacking sequence using the following methods:</p>
         
         <ul>
            
            <li>
               
               <p>From scratch, creating plies and ply groups, copying them, and moving them.</p>
               
            </li>
            
            <li>
               
               <p>Importing from a spreadsheet or a CSV file.</p>
               
            </li>
            
            <li>
               
               <p>Using the standard shorthand lamination format.</p>
               
            </li>
            
         </ul>
         
         <p>For the ply-based process, you can also import a layup that you previously defined in the <strong>Laminate Modeler</strong> dialog box.
         </p>
         
         
         <p>As you create the layup, you can see the plies and ply groups in the ply layup list and the graphical representation of the layup in the <strong>Ply Sketcher</strong> group. The layup bottom ply is shown at the bottom of the box, and the top ply at the top of the box. By default, the direction defined from the bottom ply to the top ply is the same as the shell element normal direction and the shell element nodes lie directly on the mid plane of the laminate. In the <strong>Ply Sketcher</strong> group, the laminate reference plane is shown as a solid black horizontal line.

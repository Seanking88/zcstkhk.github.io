         <h2>Techniques for applying the bolt pre-load</h2>
         <p>This activity shows three different techniques for applying a bolt pre-load to a bolt modeled as a mesh of solid elements. The bolt pre-load is applied to a cross section through the body of the bolt. </p>
         <p> You will define the bolt pre-load:</p>
         <ul>
            
            <li>
               
               <p>On a set of polygon faces resulting from a split body operation.</p>
               
            </li>
            
            <li>
               
               <p>On the nodes related to split body faces.</p>
               
            </li>
            
            <li>
               
               <p>On nodes related to elements that define a plane on the bolt shank. </p>
               
            </li>
            
         </ul>
         <p>You should avoid defining the bolt pre-load on locations where the bolt geometry changes significantly, such as where the body of the bolt meets the head of the bolt.</p>

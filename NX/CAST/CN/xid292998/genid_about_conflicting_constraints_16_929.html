         <h2>About conflicting constraints</h2>
         <p>Coupling the DOF of node pairs created a constraint that conflicts with the fixed translation constraint. The conflict occurs along the four edges of the model shared by the dependent face of the coupling constraint and faces having the fixed translation constraint. In the illustration, these edges are shown in magenta.</p>

         <p>If you attempt to solve this model, the conflicting constraints would cause the solve to terminate.</p>
         <p>You can resolve the conflicting constraints by excluding the edges where the conflicting constraint occurs, from the fixed translation constraint. The nodes on the excluded edges will still be fixed because they are coupled to fixed nodes on the independent face. </p>

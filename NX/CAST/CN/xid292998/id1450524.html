         <h2>Optional: Define additional flexible bodies</h2>
         <p>For simplicity, you have defined only one of the suspension components as a flexible body. If time permits, you can repeat the steps in this activity to define the remaining suspension components as flexible. </p>
         <ol type="1" start="1">
            
            <li>
               
               <p>In Advanced Simulation, create a FEM file, Simulation file, and SOL 103 Flexible Body solution for each of the other suspension arms.</p>
               
            </li>
            
            <li>
               
               <p>In Advanced Simulation, solve each solution to generate the .rfi file for each flexible body.</p>
               
            </li>
            
            <li>
               
               <p>In Motion Simulation, create a flexible link for each additional flexible body.</p>
               
            </li>
            
            <li>
               
               <p>Add all of the flexible links to the existing motion solution.</p>
               
            </li>
            
            <li>
               
               <p>Solve the motion solution. Note that NX Nastran will run automatically to solve the modal solution again for each flexible body. The entire solve may take several minutes to complete.</p>
               
            </li>
            
            <li>
               
               <p>Animate the results. </p>
               
               <p>Each flexible body has its own post view, which you can edit individually. In the <span class="uiTerm">Motion Navigator</span>, under the <span class="uiTerm">Animation</span> node for the solution, right-click the flexible link to edit and choose <span class="uiTerm">Edit Post View</span>.
               </p>
               
               <p>Also, when you have multiple flexible links, color contour plots are displayed only for links of a single result type. To specify the flexible link to display, in the <span class="uiTerm">Motion Navigator</span>, under the <span class="uiTerm">Animation</span> node for the solution, right-click the flexible link and choose <span class="uiTerm">Set Legend Visible</span>. The contour legend will indicate the time increment and min/max result values for all links of this result type. The contour plots for links of other result types will be displayed in gray. 
               </p>
               
               <p>In the following example, the post view for the blue suspension arm was set to <span class="uiTerm">Stress - Element-Nodal</span> and the post views for the other flexible links were set to <span class="uiTerm">Displacement - Nodal</span>. The blue suspension arm was set to <span class="uiTerm">Set Legend Visible</span>, so only its contour plot is displayed in the animation.
               </p>

         <h2>Characteristics and modeling of welded structures</h2>
         <p>A model of a welded structure has the following characteristics:</p>
         <ul>
            
            <li>
               
               <p>The plates have a constant thickness, but thickness varies between components. </p>
               
            </li>
            
            <li>
               
               <p>The plates are welded together and reinforced with gussets and ribs.</p>
               
            </li>
            
            <li>
               
               <p>The weld geometry may or may not be represented.</p>
               
            </li>
            
            <li>
               
               <p>The analysis model is based on a CAD assembly that is composed of many plates represented as solid bodies. You can create midsurfaces for these components.</p>
               
            </li>
            
            <li>
               
               <p>The plates are modeled with thin shell elements.</p>
               
            </li>
            
         </ul>

         <h2>Introduction</h2>
         <p>These examples show you two ways to mesh a bracket using hexahedral elements (brick elements). </p>
         <p>In the first example, you will learn:</p>
         <ul>
            
            <li>
               
               <p>How to simplify the CAD model.</p>
               
            </li>
            
            <li>
               
               <p>How to split the body to prepare for swept meshing.</p>
               
            </li>
            
            <li>
               
               <p>How to use edge densities to control the number of elements through the thickness of the components.</p>
               
            </li>
            
            <li>
               
               <p>How to use mapped meshes as seed faces for a swept mesh.</p>
               
            </li>
            
            <li>
               
               <p>How to generate swept meshes through the bodies in the assembly.</p>
               
            </li>
            
         </ul>
         <p>In the second example, you will use the same model but will use a different workflow. You use the <span class="uiTerm">3D Swept Meshing</span> command to sweep a hexahdral mesh from multiple, connected source faces to a single target face. This eliminates the need to split the bodies in Modeling. In this example, you will learn:
         </p>
         <ul>
            
            <li>
               
               <p>How to use edge densities to control the number of elements through the thickness of the components.</p>
               
            </li>
            
            <li>
               
               <p>How to use mapped meshes as seed faces for a swept mesh.</p>
               
            </li>
            
            <li>
               
               <p>How to generate swept meshes through the bodies in the assembly.</p>
               
            </li>
            
         </ul>

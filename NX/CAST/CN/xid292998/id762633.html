         <h2>Introduction</h2>
         
         <p>This course shows you how to analyze a segment of an integrally bladed rotor (IBR), also known as a blisk in the aerospace industry. You will learn how to:</p>
         
         <ul>
            
            <li>
               
               <p>Create 2D dependent, symmetric meshes on several faces.</p>
               
            </li>
            
            <li>
               
               <p>Create 3D swept meshes, using the 2D meshes as seed meshes.</p>
               
            </li>
            
            <li>
               
               <p>Use pyramid elements to transition between 3D tetrahedral and hexahedral meshes.</p>
               
            </li>
            
            <li>
               
               <p>Create a cyclic symmetry model. Cyclic symmetry occurs when geometry and loading is repeated about an axis of rotation. </p>
               
            </li>
            
            <li>
               
               <p>Use automatic coupling to create coupled degrees of freedom. </p>
               
            </li>
            
         </ul>

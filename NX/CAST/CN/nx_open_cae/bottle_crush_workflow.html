         <p>This section of the course describes how to create an application to automate a CAE workflow. You will use the following process:</p>
         
         <ol type="1" start="1">
            
            <li>
               
               <p>Use journal files to record and play back the steps for selected tasks in the user workflow.</p>
               
            </li>
            
            <li>
               
               <p>Create custom dialog boxes and save them as Visual Basic files.</p>
               
            </li>
            
            <li>
               
               <p>Combine journal files and dialog box definitions into applications using a third-party editor.</p>
               
            </li>
            
            <li>
               
               <p>Edit the resulting applications to enable the custom dialog boxes, generic selection, and other customizations as needed.</p>
               
            </li>
            
            <li>
               
               <p>Create custom toolbars and buttons to launch your applications.</p>
               
            </li>
            
            <li>
               
               <p>Test and debug the customized application.</p>
               
            </li>

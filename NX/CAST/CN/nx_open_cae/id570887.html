         <p>The <span class="fileName">Auto_Mesh2D_ans.vb</span> answer file is provided for comparison with your application file. If you get stuck while editing, open the answer file in Visual Studio so you can tab between the two files to locate errors. You can also use WinMerge to highlight the differences between your application file and the answer file.
         </p>
         <p></p>
         <p>If you are using Visual Studio, you will be presented with auto completion options as you type. Make sure that you are selecting the appropriate item that matches the one shown in the training material, because there are many similar items presented. This will save debugging time once you are finished.</p>
         <p>Namespaces must be imported to be used. The System, NXOpen and NXOpen.UF import statements are created by the wizard. For this project, you need the NXOpen.CAE, NXOpen.Utilities, NXOpen.UF.Obj, and NXOpenUI namespaces. Add the highlighted lines following the <span class="codeText">Imports NXOpen.UF</span> statement.

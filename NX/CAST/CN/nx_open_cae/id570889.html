         <h2>Create and initialize object references</h2>
         <p>In order to create the required objects and use the methods to operate on them, the object references to the Base Part, Base FEMPart and Base FEModel need to be declared. The objects that you will need for this project, like a mesh collector, are created using a reference to these objects. Add the highlighted code below <span class="codeText">Sub Main()</span>.
         </p><pre class="codeExample ">Sub Main()

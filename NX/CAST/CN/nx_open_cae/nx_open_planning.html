         <h2>Planning an NX Open for CAE application</h2>
         
         <p>When planning an NX Open for CAE application, you should approach it like any other software development project. When automating especially complex tasks, you may want to assemble a team consisting of contributors skilled in the following areas:</p>
         
         <ul>
            
            <li>
               
               <p>General CAE analysis types and workflows.</p>
               
            </li>
            
            <li>
               
               <p>The NX user interface, and specifically Advanced Simulation workflows and data structures.</p>
               
            </li>
            
            <li>
               
               <p>NX Open skills and experience.</p>
               
            </li>
            
            <li>
               
               <p>Application programming.</p>
               
            </li>
            
         </ul>
         
         <p>As with any other software development project, be sure you understand your functional and UI requirements, the target user, use cases, and the inputs, processing, and outputs for your intended application.</p>

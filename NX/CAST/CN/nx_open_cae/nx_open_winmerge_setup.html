         <p>Siemens PLM Software provides an example of a completed application for this course, named <span class="literalText">createAppendAppAns.vb</span>.
         </p>
         <p>Before proceeding, it is a good idea to open your application and the completed application file in a differencing and merging tool to make sure that editing errors are caught.</p>

         <h2>NX Open for CAE documentation resources</h2>
         
         <p>There are two key documentation resources that you will need to use when you create applications with NX Open for CAE:</p>
         
         <ul>
            
            <li>
               
               <p>The NX Open API documentation.</p>
               
            </li>
            
            <li>
               
               <p>The NX Open for CAE documentation.</p>
               
            </li>
            
         </ul>
         
         <p> Both of these resources can be found in the <span class="titleReference">Programming Tools</span> documentation within the <span class="titleReference">NX Help Library</span>.
         </p>

            <h3>NX Open API documentation</h3>
            
            <p>The general NX Open API documentation provides information on all classes for each of the major programming languages (for example, .NET, Java, C++). </p>
            
            <p>For example, <span class="uiTerm">NX Help Library</span>&rarr;<span class="uiTerm">Programming Tools</span>&rarr;<span class="uiTerm">NX Open</span>&rarr;<span class="uiTerm">Open for .NET</span>&rarr;<span class="uiTerm">NX Open for .NET Reference Guide</span> provides a complete API reference for NX Open for .NET in Microsoft Compiled Help (.chm) format. You may find this documentation especially helpful for this course.
            </p>
            
            <table class="attentionTable attn_note">

                     <p>The CAE classes are found in the <span class="codeText">NXOpen.CAE</span> namespace.
                     </p>

               </tr>
            </table>
            
            <p>The documentation for each class includes:</p>
            
            <ul>
               
               <li>
                  
                  <p>A short description of the class.</p>
                  
               </li>
               
               <li>
                  
                  <p>A list of the members of that class, including the available properties and methods.</p>
                  
               </li>
               
               <li>
                  
                  <p>Remarks, which can contain information on how to create an instance of the class.</p>
                  
               </li>
               
               <li>
                  
                  <p>An instance hierarchy, which displays the predecessors that the class inherits from. This is useful for finding the <span class="emphasis">interface</span> classes, which are common in the NX CAE data model.
                  </p>
                  
                  <p>For example, notice how the <span class="codeText">MeshManager</span> and <span class="codeText">MeshManagerOccurrence</span> classes share the same <span class="emphasis">interface</span> class:

            <h3>NX Open for CAE documentation</h3>
            
            <p>The <span class="titleReference">NX Open for CAE</span> documentation supplements the general NX Open API documentation. It includes documentation for the CAE <span class="emphasis">Solver Environment</span> (solver languages) and on the meshing technologies supported by the NX CAE applications.
            </p>
            
            <p>You can find it at: <span class="uiTerm">NX Help Library</span>&rarr;<span class="uiTerm">Programming Tools</span>&rarr;<span class="uiTerm">NX Open</span>&rarr;<span class="uiTerm">Open for CAE</span>.
            </p>
            
            <p>In the <span class="emphasis">Solver Environment</span> section, for each supported solver, the documentation lists all supported entities and includes:
            </p>
            
            <ul>
               
               <li>
                  
                  <p>The language-specific name and the name that appears in the user interface. Sometimes these names are the same, and sometimes they are different. Additionally, the name you need to provide in NX Open for CAE applications is not consistent. Therefore, the name required by NX Open for CAE is shown in red.</p>
                  
               </li>
               
               <li>
                  
                  <p>a link to sample JA code, which demonstrates correct coding for each entity.</p>
                  
               </li>
               
            </ul>
            
            <p>The following graphic shows an example of the documentation for the NX Nastran CBEAM element. In this case, CBEAM is both the name that appears in the NX user interface and the name you need to provide to NX Open.</p>

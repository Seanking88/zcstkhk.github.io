         <h2>Generating code</h2>
         
         <p>NX provides tools to quickly generate NX-compatible code for your custom application. These tools include:</p>
         
         <ul>
            
            <li>
               
               <p>Journals. The Journal utility is a rapid automation tool that records, edits, and replays interactive NX sessions. Built from the Common API and based on .NET, it produces a scripted file from an interactive session of NX which can be run at a later time to replay the session. </p>
               
            </li>
            
            <li>
               
               <p>Block Styler. Block Styler is an application that you can use to interactively build dialog boxes that are consistent with the NX block-based user interface. Block Styler produces two types of files as output: A DLX file used by NX to generate the dialog box at runtime, and a template code file. </p>
               
            </li>
            
         </ul>
         
         <p>By combining journal files with Block Styler template code files, you can automate complex procedures and provide a customized, streamlined UI to ensure consistency and ease-of-use.</p>

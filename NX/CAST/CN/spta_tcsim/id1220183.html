         <h2>Where is NX data in Teamcenter?</h2>
         
         <p>Native NX users are accustomed to browsing through operating system folders in search of part <span class="literalText">(.prt)</span> files. 
         </p>
         <a name="ndxgenid_spta_tcsim_14"></a>

            <li>
               
               <p>Teamcenter stores the part <span class="literalText">(.prt)</span> files in a database and uses data objects to symbolically represent them. Data objects function as a reference to the actual object in the database.
               </p>
               
            </li>
            
            <li>
               
               <p>Teamcenter Integration for NX folders look like folders in a file system, although they are more like envelopes: they carry messages and information but do not have your parts, assemblies, or drawings in them.</p>
               
            </li>
            
            <li>
               
               <p>Using this symbolic reference, access to a single object can be made available to many users.</p>
               
            </li>
            
         </ul>
         
         <p>Items <img align="bottom" src="../graphics/graphicLibrary/teamcenter/end_user/integration_for_nx/basic_concepts/end_user_integration_lmd_i_item.gif" border="0"> and item revisions <img align="bottom" src="../graphics/graphicLibrary/teamcenter/end_user/integration_for_nx/basic_concepts/end_user_integration_lmd_i_item_revision.gif" border="0"> are the fundamental objects used to manage information in Teamcenter.

               <p>Items are structures that represent a product, part, or component. Items can contain other data objects, including other items and folders.</p><a name="ndxgenid_spta_tcsim_15"></a>

            <li>
               
               <p>Item revisions contain information related to a revision in addition to the NX dataset. Datasets manage data files created by applications outside of Teamcenter. This example is an NX dataset.</p><a name="ndxgenid_spta_tcsim_17"></a>

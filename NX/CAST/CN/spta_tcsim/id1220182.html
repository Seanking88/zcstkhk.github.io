         <h2>NX in Teamcenter Integration for NX versus native mode</h2>
         
         <p>The dialog boxes that appear while running Teamcenter Integration for NX are similar in appearance to the standard NX dialog boxes. Instead of working directly with part files organized at the operating system level, Teamcenter Integration for NX allows you to search for and select part files based on data stored in the Teamcenter database.</p>

         <p>Following are some advantages of using NX in Teamcenter Integration for NX mode:</p>
         
         <ul>
            
            <li>
               
               <p>There is no need to specify directories in the path name for your parts. Teamcenter Integration for NX organizes and finds the parts for you.</p>
               
            </li>
            
            <li>
               
               <p>You can create, access and modify part files directly in the database.</p>
               
            </li>
            
            <li>
               
               <p>You can supply configuration rules when loading assemblies to determine which revisions of component parts are loaded from the database.</p>
               
            </li>
            
            <li>
               
               <p>Related files like drawings and manufacturing files can be organized with the master geometry so they are easy to find and manage.</p>

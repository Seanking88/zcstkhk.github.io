         <h2>Activity: Edit routing paths</h2>
         
         <p>In this activity, you will make a change that requires this last wiring segment to be routed through a clamp. You could add one to the assembly, but you can also add one to your wiring harness subassembly. That way if you use the harness in a formboard layout, the clamp can be included with it.</p>

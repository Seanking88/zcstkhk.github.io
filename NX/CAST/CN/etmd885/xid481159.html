         <h2>Your Answer: Yes</h2>
         <p>You are correct. Internal Part Modules and external Linked Part Modules can be used in the context of an assembly but the WAVE links that are created are only within the main part file and its Part Modules. WAVE links are not created between parts within the context of the assembly.</p>
         <p>For more training material about WAVE linking geometry between components in an assembly, please see the following lessons in the WAVE Engineering course.</p>

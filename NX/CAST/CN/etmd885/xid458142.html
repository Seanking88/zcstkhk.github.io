         <h2>Your answer: Four designers</h2>
         <p>You are correct. There are three external Linked Part Modules that could be worked on by three different secondary designers. The two internal Part Modules can be accessed only by the principal designer. The principal designer and the three secondary designers can work concurrently in the main part file and the three Linked Part Module files, respectively. </p>

         <p>In this tutorial, you will use basic geometry idealization and abstraction commands to simplify a model in preparation for meshing. You will use the <span class="uiTerm">Split Body</span> command to partition the model and then remove features from the geometry, including edge blends and a slot that are not significant to the analysis. You will then solve and analyze the results.

         <h2>Examine the imported model</h2>
         <p>When the import process is complete, the <span class="uiTerm">Information</span> window displays this information:
         </p>
         <ul>
            
            <li>
               
               <p>The Analysis of Import section lists information about each Nastran bulk data entry recognized and the number of entities imported for each bulk data entry.  </p>
               
            </li>
            
            <li>
               
               <p>The Summary of Import section list the number of nodes, coordinate systems, restraints, elements, physical properties, materials, and loads imported.  </p>
               
            </li>
            
         </ul>
         <p>Notice that a Simulation file has been created and the loads and boundary conditions have been imported. Also, all of the rigid elements and beam elements have been imported.</p>

         <p>The new Simulation file should be displayed in NX. </p>

         <p>As you can see, importing the NX Nastran bulk data file offers a more complete import of your I-deas model. </p>

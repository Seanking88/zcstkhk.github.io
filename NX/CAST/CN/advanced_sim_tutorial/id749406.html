         <h2>Activity: Response Simulation &ndash; FE Model Setup</h2>
         
         <p align="center"><img align="bottom" src="../graphics/nonLocalized/nx_dss/activities/response_1_anim.gif"></p>
         
         <p>NX Response Simulation is an Advanced Simulation solution process for use with NX Nastran. It allows you to evaluate the dynamic responses of a structural model subjected to various loading conditions. The software calculates these responses using modal approaches.</p>
         
         <p>The Response Simulation tutorial focuses on evaluation of the dynamic displacements and stresses in a bracket used to support an electronics module in an engine compartment. It is divided into two activities:</p>
         
         <ul>
            
            <li>
               
               <p>Response Simulation &ndash; FE model setup: You prepare the simulation files and define the boundary conditions and solution options necessary for performing a response simulation. You then solve the model and examine the normal modes.</p>
               
            </li>
            
            <li>
               
               <p>Response Simulation &ndash; analysis events: You perform three response simulations, including transmissibility, transient analysis, and random analysis. </p>
               
            </li>
            
         </ul>
         
         <p>For detailed information about the procedures and concepts discussed in this tutorial, see the <span class="titleReference">Response Simulation</span> section in the <span class="titleReference">Advanced Simulation online help</span>.

         <h2>Examine the imported model</h2>
         <p>When the import is complete, the <span class="uiTerm">Information</span> window displays the details of the import process:
         </p>
         <ul>
            
            <li>
               
               <p>A new FEM file was created (but no Simulation file). </p>
               
            </li>
            
            <li>
               
               <p>Five beam sections were imported.</p>
               
            </li>
            
            <li>
               
               <p>Eight physical property tables were created.</p>
               
            </li>
            
            <li>
               
               <p>Three materials were created.</p>
               
            </li>
            
            <li>
               
               <p>8040 nodes were created.</p>
               
            </li>
            
            <li>
               
               <p>4485 elements were read, of which 4427 elements were created. There were 58 rigid elements, which cannot be imported into NX using the UNV translator.</p>
               
            </li>
            
            <li>
               
               <p>Two groups were created.</p>
               
            </li>
            
            <li>
               
               <p>Beam associated data was also created.</p>
               
            </li>
            
         </ul>
         <p>To complete this model in NX, you would need to add the 58 rigid elements and also create the Simulation file with the loads and boundary conditions. </p>

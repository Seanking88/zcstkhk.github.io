         <h2>Camera types</h2>
         
         <p>There are two types of cameras:</p>
         
         <ul>
            
            <li>
               
               <p><span class="uiTerm">Parallel</span> &ndash; specifies that the model appears with no distortion regardless of how far it is from the camera.
               </p>
               
               <p align="center"><img align="bottom" src="../graphics/nonLocalized/nx/gateway/model_views/camera/visualization_activities_arch_3234_3a.png"></p>
               
            </li>
            
            <li>
               
               <p><span class="uiTerm">Perspective</span> &ndash;  specifies that the view of a model's shape is deformed based on its distance from the target and its field of view angle. The distance from the target is calculated from the eye point to the target point.
               </p>

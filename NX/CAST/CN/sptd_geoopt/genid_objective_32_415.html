         <p>The objective is measured during each iteration against the type of goal you want to reach. You can: </p>
         
         <ul>
            
            <li>
               
               <p>Minimize the objective</p>
               
            </li>
            
            <li>
               
               <p>Maximize the objective</p>
               
            </li>
            
            <li>
               
               <p>Drive the objective toward a target value</p>
               
            </li>
            
         </ul>
         
         <p>The types of objectives available depend on the solution type your geometry optimization is based on. For example, you can minimize stress or displacement, or maximize a natural frequency. Displacement, stress, and reaction force objectives require the use of the <span class="uiTerm">Result Measure</span> command to extract the results from the solution.

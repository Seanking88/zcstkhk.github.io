         <p><span class="emphasis">Design constraints</span> define your upper and lower limits on a specific attribute. The constraint puts limits on what the optimization can change in its attempt to meet the design objective. 
         </p>
         
         <p>Geometry optimization uses the results from an analysis, typically displacement or stress, as input to evaluating the constraints. </p>
         
         <p>During each iteration, the software compares the value of each constraint attribute against its limit. If a constraint value falls outside its limit, the model is considered to be in an invalid state. The optimization returns to the previous valid state and tries different values for the design variables.</p>
         
         <p>You can constrain weight, volume, and frequency. In addition, you can use the <span class="uiTerm">Result Measure</span> command to extract the results of the solution, such as displacement, stress, and reaction force, for use as a constraint.

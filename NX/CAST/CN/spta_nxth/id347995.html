            <h3>Solution options</h3>
            
            <p>You can set simulation options in the <span class="uiTerm">Solution</span> dialog box. The most commonly used settings are located on the <span class="uiTerm">Solution Details</span> and the <span class="uiTerm">Ambient Conditions</span> tabs. You should always review the settings on the other tabs when they apply to the model you are solving.
            </p>
            
            <p>For steady state solutions setting expected values for the solution on the <span class="uiTerm">Initial Conditions</span> tab may save analysis time.
            </p>
            
            <ul>
               
               <li>
                  
                  <p>For a transient analysis, you must specify a <span class="uiTerm">Start Time</span> and an <span class="uiTerm">End Time</span> in the <span class="uiTerm">Transient Setup</span> tab, and review the other settings. You can set global initial boundary conditions in the <span class="uiTerm">Initial Conditions</span> tab.
                  </p>

                  <p>For a large model, deselecting the options for unneeded results types on the <span class="uiTerm">Results Options</span> tab can improve processing time and reduce the size of the results file.

            <h3>Solver Parameters</h3>
            
            <p>Use <span class="uiTerm">Solver Parameters</span> to control time step, convergence, speed calculation time, or to adjust the solver for unusual modeling situations. For example you must set an appropriate time step for natural convection problems.
            </p>
            
            <p>After every solution, you should verify the convergence of the model. Review the message files for global heat balance and mass balance for flow problems. Investigate warnings and check the view factor sums for radiation problems.</p>

            <p>You usually restart an analysis in the following situations:</p>
            
            <ul>
               
               <li>
                  
                  <p>A steady state analysis has reached its iteration limit but has not converged yet.</p>
                  
               </li>
               
               <li>
                  
                  <p>A transient analysis has been run and you wish to continue the analysis over a new end time. </p>
                  
               </li>
               
               <li>
                  
                  <p>You have stopped a steady state or transient analysis and wish to continue the run.</p>
                  
               </li>
               
               <li>
                  
                  <p>You want re run your model with different properties but want to reuse information already calculated. For example you want to change an object's emissivity but reuse previously calculated view factors.</p>
                  
               </li>
               
            </ul>
            
            <p>To perform a simulation restart use the options available in the <span class="uiTerm">Restart</span> tab of the <span class="uiTerm">Solution</span> dialog box.

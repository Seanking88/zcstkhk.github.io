         <h2>Symmetry </h2>

         <p>Models that exhibit symmetry can be reduced, or &ldquo;sliced,&rdquo; into repeating pieces. Analyzing one piece of the model with appropriate boundary conditions applied provides results that are representative of the entire model.</p>
         
         <p>A model is symmetric when the model geometry is symmetric and:</p>
         
         <ul>
            
            <li>
               
               <p>The loads in the model exhibit the same symmetry.</p>
               
            </li>
            
            <li>
               
               <p>The constraints in the model exhibit the same symmetry.</p>
               
            </li>
            
            <li>
               
               <p>The behavior of the materials used in the model exhibit the same symmetry.</p>
               
            </li>
            
         </ul>

         <p>Taking advantage of symmetry reduces the size of the model. Because the model is smaller:</p>
         
         <ul>
            
            <li>
               
               <p>The solution time is reduced, or,</p>
               
            </li>
            
            <li>
               
               <p>A more refined mesh can be used to improve accuracy without increasing the solution time.</p>

         <h2>Axisymmetry</h2>

         <p>Axisymmetry occurs when a geometric part is a solid of revolution and the loads, constraints, and material properties are independent of the circumferential direction. </p>
         
         <p>Advanced Simulation supports the following analyses: </p>
         
         <ul>
            
            <li>
               
               <p>Axisymmetric structural</p>
               
            </li>
            
            <li>
               
               <p>Axisymmetric thermal</p>
               
            </li>
            
            <li>
               
               <p>Axisymmetric thermal-structural</p>
               
            </li>
            
         </ul>
         
         <p>You can perform an axisymmetric analysis on solids of revolution by creating the FE model on a cross section on one side of the rotational axis.</p>

            Axisymmetric analysis lets you solve an FE model that is defined for only a section cut on one side of the axis of an axisymmetric part. This greatly reduces the degrees of freedom (DOF) and hence also significantly reduces solution time.

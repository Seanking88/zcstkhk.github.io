         <p>Child view with circular, rectangular, or user&ndash;defined boundary which contains an enlarged portion of an already existing drawing view. </p>

         <p>Also referred to as <span class="emphasis">drawing member view</span>.
         </p>
         
         <p>Standard orthographic view created from a model view, or a view of 2D curves that represent model geometry. A drafting view contains drawing objects. It is listed in the<span class="uiTerm"> Part Navigator</span> under the associated <span class="uiTerm">Sheet</span> node.

         <p>View that contains drafting views and drawing border objects. Drawing sheet views are listed in the <span class="uiTerm">Part Navigator</span> under the associated <span class="uiTerm">Drawing</span> node.
         </p>
         <a name="id534643"></a><p class="glossaryTerm">drawing view</p>
         
         <p>Empty view used to manually create a sketch instead of displaying an associative base view of a model.</p>

         <p>Component file that contains the defining geometry that is referenced by an assembly, drawing, or manufacturing part. For example, in NX, the master model is normally kept in one file, and a drawing in another. When the master model is modified, the drawing views can be updated to reflect the changes.</p>

         <p>Movable coordinate system. The coordinates of the WCS are called <span class="emphasis">work coordinates</span> and are denoted by XC, YC, ZC axes. The XC-YC plane is called the <span class="emphasis">work plane</span>.

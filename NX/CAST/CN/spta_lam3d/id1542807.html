         <h2>Inflating laminates</h2>
         
         <p> You can inflate a 2D laminate that you created using both the ply-based process and the zone-based process in one of these ways:</p>
         
         <ul>
            
            <li>
               
               <p>Use the <span class="uiTerm">Extrude Laminate</span> command to extrude a 2D laminate over a 2D mesh to create a 3D mesh.
               </p>
               
            </li>
            
            <li>
               
               <p>Use the <span class="uiTerm">Fill Laminate</span> command to create 3D meshes between one or more sets of 2D dependent meshes.
               </p>
               
            </li>
            
         </ul>
         
         <p>You can use the solid mesh to get better results in the ply out-of-plane direction.</p>
         
         <p>The laminate information is taken from the <span class="uiTerm">Laminate</span> physical property either alone in the zone-based process or with global layup information in the ply-based process.
         </p>
         
         <p>You cannot view the fiber orientations of the 3D extruded elements.</p>
         
         
         <p>NX creates the following meshes and mesh collectors:</p>
         
         <ul>
            
            <li>
               
               <p>A 3D mesh collector for each laminate physical property that is referenced by the inflated elements. The 3D mesh collectors contain meshes for the 3D plies.</p>
               
               <p>One 3D mesh per ply or ply group for each 2D mesh collector. The number of solid layers created depends on the <span class="uiTerm">Single Ply per 3D Layer</span> check box and on number of ply groups. Each solid layer is a separate 3D mesh.
               </p>
               
            </li>
            
            <li>
               
               <p>A mesh collector that contains ply drop-off meshes. This mesh collector is called <span class="uiTerm">Extrusion Resin</span>. The <span class="uiTerm">Extrusion Resin</span> mesh collector points to a solid property and to the isotropic Epoxy material from the NX library. You can change this material.
               </p>
               
               <p>Drop-off meshes. These meshes are called <span class="uiTerm">Resin Elements</span>.
               </p>
               
            </li>
            
         </ul>

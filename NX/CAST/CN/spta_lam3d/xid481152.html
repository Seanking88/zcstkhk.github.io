         <h2>Advantages of using 3D elements</h2>
         
         <p>Consider switching to 3D elements if you suspect that the 2D plane stress assumption is no longer valid. This could happen when, for example, you have laminates of significant thickness, and are concerned about through-thickness stresses. Another example would be when you are concerned about the influence of ply drop-off areas, corners, or free-edge regions.</p>
         
         <p>The advantages are:</p>
         
         <ul>
            
            <li>
               
               <p>One 3D element can have a varying thickness, whereas 2D element ply thicknesses are constant.</p>
               
            </li>
            
            <li>
               
               <p>Ply drop off wedge elements with resin properties ensure a more realistic representation of ply drop-off areas.</p>
               
            </li>
            
            <li>
               
               <p>3D elements calculate through-thickness stresses.</p>
               
            </li>
            
            <li>
               
               <p>You can model the laminate stack as either of the following:</p>
               
               <ul>
                  
                  <li>
                     
                     <p>A single 3D element layer, where there is only one element for all plies.</p>
                     
                  </li>
                  
                  <li>
                     
                     <p>Every ply as an individual 3D layer, where there is one element per ply.</p>
                     
                  </li>
                  
               </ul>
               
            </li>
            
         </ul>

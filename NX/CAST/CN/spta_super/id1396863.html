         <h2>Static reduction &mdash; understanding boundary DOFs</h2>
         
         <p>If only stiffness is reduced (static condensation), boundary DOF selection is not critical to accuracy.</p>
         
         <p>Select only the boundary DOFs necessary for connection and orientation.  Additional boundary DOFs do not improve accuracy and may degrade performance.</p>
         
         <p>If you include mass or damping in the superelement, preserving the overall mass distribution is an important consideration when selecting the boundary DOF. This depends on how you plan to use of the superelement:</p>
         
         <ul>
            
            <li>
               
               <p>Mass is required for acceleration loading in subsequent static system solutions.</p>
               
            </li>
            
            <li>
               
               <p>Mass is typically included for subsequent dynamic system solutions.</p>
               
            </li>

         <h2>静态降阶概述</h2>
         
         <p>SOL 101 超单元解算方案类型Superelement solution type performs a static condensation of stiffness and a Guyan reduction of mass and damping.</p>
         
         <p>If only stiffness exists in the model, the reduction is a static condensation. This occurs when no mass or damping is defined. For example, density is undefined on the material definitions.</p>
         
         <p>Static condensation exactly represents the original stiffness with no loss of accuracy. You can use static condensation in any subsequent solution which requires only stiffness.</p>
         
         <p>If mass and/or damping also exist, the reduction is considered a Guyan reduction. In a Guyan reduction, all interior mass is lumped on the boundary DOF.</p>
         
         
         <p>You can safely and effectively use a statically reduced superelement in a subsequent static solution.</p>
         
         <p>Significant error may result if you use a statically reduced superelement in a dynamic solution where it is not appropriate. It may be appropriate to use a static condensation in a dynamic solution if:</p>
         
         <ul>
            
            <li>
               
               <p>The component is very stiff relative to the rest of the structure. </p>
               
            </li>
            
            <li>
               
               <p>You want to exclude the dynamics of a region of the model.</p>

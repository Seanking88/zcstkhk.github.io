         <h2>Dynamic reduction overview</h2>
         
         <p>The SEMODES 103 &ndash; Superelement solution type performs a dynamic reduction.</p>
         
         <p>A dynamic reduction combines dynamic and static behavior.</p>
         
         <ul>
            
            <li>
               
               <p>The dynamic portion of the solution computes normal modes of the structure. These modes are called <span class="emphasis">component modes,</span> and are assigned to new, modal DOF.
               </p>
               
            </li>
            
            <li>
               
               <p>The static portion of the solution is the same as a static condensation or Guyan reduction. Stiffness, mass, and damping of the omitted DOF are reduced to the boundary DOF.</p>
               <p>The static portion of a dynamic reduction is sometimes referred to as the <span class="emphasis">constraint modes.</span> It is mathematically equivalent to applying a unit enforced motion constraint to all boundary DOFs, and treating omitted DOFs as fixed.
               </p>
               
            </li>
            
         </ul>
         
         <p>Dynamic reduction in NX is also referred to as component mode synthesis (CMS). The CMS method allows the boundary DOFs to be free or fixed boundary DOFs.</p>

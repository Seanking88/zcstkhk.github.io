         <h2>Dynamic reduction &mdash; dynamic and static behavior</h2>
         
         <p>You can accurately use a dynamically reduced superelement in either a dynamic or static system run solution. </p>
         
         <p>Using a dynamically reduced superelement in a dynamic solution:</p>
         
         <ul>
            
            <li>
               
               <p>The component modes account for the dynamic behavior.</p>
               
            </li>
            
            <li>
               
               <p>The constraint modes account for any local flexibility at the boundaries which may not be accounted for in the component modes. </p>
               
            </li>
            
         </ul>
         
         <p>Using a dynamically reduced superelement in a static solution:</p>
         
         <ul>
            
            <li>
               
               <p>The constraint modes accurately account for the stiffness.  </p>
               
            </li>
            
            <li>
               
               <p>The component modes are ignored.</p>
               
            </li>
            
            <li>
               
               <p>Because the component modes are not used in a static solution, the additional resources required to compute them may offset any efficiency gains.</p>
               
            </li>

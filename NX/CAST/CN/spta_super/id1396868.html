         <h2>Dynamic reduction &mdash; understanding boundary DOFs</h2>
         
         <p>Boundary DOFs can be free or fixed. </p>
         
         <ul>
            
            <li>
               
               <p>When the component modes are computed, the fixed boundary DOF are constrained and the free boundary DOF are free.</p>
               
            </li>
            
            <li>
               
               <p>Boundary DOFs which connect to residual nodes in a dynamic system run solution are typically specified as fixed boundary DOF.</p>
               
            </li>
            
            <li>
               
               <p>Boundary DOFs which may be used as the location of a load or to specify superelement orientation are typically specified as free boundary DOFs.</p>
               
            </li>
            
         </ul>
         
         <p>The free/fixed distinction is not always critical to the accuracy of a subsequent dynamic system run solution, because the static portion of the dynamic reduction can contribute to the local dynamic behavior at the boundary DOFs.</p>

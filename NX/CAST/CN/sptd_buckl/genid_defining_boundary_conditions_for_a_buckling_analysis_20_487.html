         <p>For a buckling analysis:</p>
         
         <ol type="1" start="1">
            
            <li>
               
               <p>Define constraints. Constrain the model as you would for a linear static analysis.</p>
               
            </li>
            
            <li>
               
               <p>Apply loads. The load set can contain more than one load type (Force, Pressure), but every load will be scaled by the load factor. A magnitude of 1 is often used when a single load type will cause the model to buckle.</p>
               
            </li>

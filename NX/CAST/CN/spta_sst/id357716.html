            <h3>Solar Heating Space</h3>
            
            <p>Use a <span class="uiTerm">Solar Heating Space</span> <img align="bottom" src="../graphics/nonLocalized/nx/icons/icons/toolbars/simulation/advanced_simulation/solar_heating.gif" border="0"> simulation object to model heating of objects on the surface of a planet due to sun incidence. This command calculates direct solar view factors for selected elements at a fixed sun position or at calculation points along the sun's trajectory. Solar view factors are the direct view of an element to the solar source, which is treated as a distant point source. You can model multiple solar sources to simulate multi-directional heating of elements in a multi-star system. 
            </p>
            
            <p><span class="uiTerm">Solar Heating Space</span> is useful, for example, for modeling the thermal effects of the sun on exterior equipment, buildings, and installations.

            <p>The options on the <span class="uiTerm">Model Orientation</span> tab of the <span class="uiTerm">Solar Heating Space</span> dialog box let you position the model in relation to the sun to determine how the sun strikes it.

                  <p><span class="uiTerm">Latitude</span> &mdash; The options in the <span class="uiTerm">Planet Vectors</span> and <span class="uiTerm">Solar Vectors</span> group let you define two vectors to orient the model in relation to the Earth or selected planet. These two vectors cannot be parallel to each other. Often, they are perpendicular to each other.

            <p>Create a <span class="uiTerm">Radiative Heating</span> simulation object to define selected elements in your model as diffusely or collimated radiating heat sources. The software then calculates the direct heat flux view factors to other elements per heat source that you define.

         <h2>Creating meshes using primitives volumes</h2>
         <p>You can define a mesh:</p>
         <ul>
            
            <li>
               
               <p>On geometry created in the Modeling application or imported from other CAD modeling packages.</p>
               
            </li>
            
            <li>
               
               <p>Using primitives in the FEM file to create structured 2D or 3D meshes based on a simple geometric form type. You must specify the size, location, and orientation based on an associated coordinate system, and mesh density of the elements. </p>
               
            </li>
            
         </ul>
         <p align="center"><img align="bottom" src="../graphics/nonLocalized/nx_dss/adv_sim/activities/maya/sst_satellite/sst_pres006.gif" border="0"><img align="bottom" src="../graphics/nonLocalized/nx_dss/adv_sim/activities/maya/sst_satellite/sst_pres008.gif" border="0"></p>
         <p>You can define primitives by:</p>
         <ul>
            
            <li>
               
               <p><span class="uiTerm">Points</span> &mdash; Allow you to specify three-dimensional coordinates to define key points to provide the shape information of the primitive.
               </p>
               
            </li>
            
            <li>
               
               <p><span class="uiTerm">Parameters</span> &mdash; Allow you to define the primitive in relation to the X, Y, and Z-axes of a coordinate system using angular and linear values. 
               </p>
               
            </li>
            
         </ul>
         <p>You can position the primitive with respect to the global coordinate system by translating or rotating the primitive's origin. You can define a primitive mesh and define a mesh collector to assign material, physical, and thermo-optical properties to it. Alternatively, you can define a mesh collector first and then assign the primitive mesh you create to it. </p>
         <p>When you create a primitive with 2D elements, the top side of each 2D element faces a specific direction by default, depending on the type of primitive.</p>
         <ul>
            
            <li>
               
               <p>With three-dimensional primitives, such as the <span class="uiTerm">Box Primitive</span> or <span class="uiTerm">Sphere Primitive</span>, the top sides of the associated 2D elements face outward, away from the primitive. 
               </p>
               
            </li>
            
            <li>
               
               <p>With two-dimensional primitives, such as the <span class="uiTerm">Rectangle Primitive</span> or <span class="uiTerm">Disc Primitive</span> that you create by specifying parameters, the top sides of the associated 2D elements face the +Z direction. 
               </p>
               
            </li>
            
            <li>
               
               <p>With two-dimensional primitives, such as the <span class="uiTerm">Rectangle Primitive</span> or <span class="uiTerm">Disc Primitive</span>, that you create by selecting points, the top sides of the associated 2D elements are determined by the right hand rule, using the sequence P1, P2, P3 to define a rotation. 
               </p>
               
            </li>
            
         </ul>

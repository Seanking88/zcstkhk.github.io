         <h2>Defining physical properties</h2>
         <p>Physical properties define characteristics of your part that are not being explicitly modeled. Use the properties in the <span class="uiTerm">Physical Properties Manager</span> <img align="bottom" src="../graphics/nonLocalized/nx/icons/icons/toolbars/simulation/advanced_simulation/physical_properties.gif" border="0"> dialog box to describe the physical qualities and characteristics of an element, such as thickness, layer stack definition, and others.
         </p>
         <p>You can define physical properties to specify:</p>
         <ul>
            
            <li>
               
               <p>A spherical <span class="uiTerm">Concentrated Mass</span> with a diameter and mass that you specify for 0D elements. For example, you can model the effect of rivets in a riveted plate under thermal loads by creating 0D elements at the appropriate locations and then assigning a concentrated mass to them. You can also use 0D elements to model the mass of liquid inside a soda can without modeling the liquid volume as a 3D mesh.
               </p>
               
            </li>
            
            <li>
               
               <p>A linear uniformly varying <span class="uiTerm">Non-Structural Mass</span> in <span class="uiTerm">Mass per Length</span> units, for 1D Beam elements. Use this to add additional capacitance to 1D elements. 
               </p>
               
            </li>
            
            <li>
               
               <p>A <span class="uiTerm">Thickness</span> value, or a <span class="uiTerm">Non-Structural Mass</span> value in mass per area units, for Thin Shell collectors of 2D Shell elements. Use the <span class="uiTerm">Non-Structural Mass</span> to add weight without explicitly modeling geometry and meshing elements for it. For example, material inserts and surface coatings.
               </p>
               
            </li>
            
            <li>
               
               <p>A <span class="uiTerm">Layer Definition</span> for a <span class="uiTerm">Multi-Layer Shell Uniform</span> collector type definition for 2D shell elements, in which you specify the <span class="uiTerm">Total Thickness</span> and the <span class="uiTerm">Number of Layers</span>. 
               </p>
               <p>Use this property to model multiple layers with detailed through-plane conduction and conduction. </p>
               
            </li>
            
            <li>
               
               <p>A layer <span class="uiTerm">Stack Definition</span> for a <span class="uiTerm">Multi-Layer Shell Non-Uniform</span> collector type definition for 2D shell elements, in which you define a layer stack with multiple <span class="uiTerm">Layer</span> modeling objects. 
               </p>
               <p>Each layer can have defined different materials, thickness, and thermo-optical properties. </p>
               
               <p>Use this property to model conductive or radiative heat transfer through the physical layers of a sandwich material construction. For example, you can use <span class="uiTerm">Multi-Layer Shell Non-Uniform</span> to model accurate heat transfer through <span class="emphasis">Multi-Layer Insulation</span> (MLI) material used to cover spacecraft.
               </p>
               
            </li>
            
         </ul>
         <p>When you define a physical property in the active FEM file, you assign it to a mesh collector. The meshes and their elements are assigned to the mesh collector inherit those physical properties.  </p>

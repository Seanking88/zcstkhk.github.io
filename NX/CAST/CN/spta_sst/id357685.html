            <h3>View Factors</h3>
            
            <p>A <span class="emphasis">view factor</span> represents the fraction of radiative energy that is emitted from one entity and arrives to a second entity. The thermal solver uses view factors to compute radiative heat transfer. 
            </p>
            
            <p>Two parallel surfaces in close proximity have a view factor that tends to unity. Two surfaces that are nearly co-planar have a view factor that tends to zero.</p>

            <h3>Enclosures</h3>
            
            <p>An enclosure divides the space into compartments on which view factors for a radiation requests are calculated. View factor calculation is expensive in terms of machine resources, therefore defining radiation enclosures saves solution time.</p>
            
            <p>For radiation requests with transmissivity thermo-optical properties defined, the solver will automatically track rays that go through elements.</p>
            
            <p>You can indicate that an enclosure radiates to ambient. In this case the solver will create radiative conductances from a point at a very large distance outside the model to elements of the enclosure visible to the point.</p>

            <p>Specular reflection is the perfect reflection of radiation from a surface, in which a ray from a single incoming direction is reflected into a single outgoing direction. The law of reflection describes such behavior. Specular reflections are not included in radiation interchange unless you specifically request them. To include specular reflections you must:</p>

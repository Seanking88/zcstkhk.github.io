         <h2>Superelement mapping considerations</h2>
         
         <p>When you map superelements to your system model, consider the following:</p>
         
         <ul>
            
            <li>
               
               <p>The assembly FEM may be associative or non-associative.</p>
               
            </li>
            
            <li>
               
               <p>All assembly FEM components to be represented by superelements must also have a FEM representation (nodes and elements).</p>
               
            </li>
            
            <li>
               
               <p>The base FEM does not need to be the same FEM as that used to generate the superelement, but it should share the same orientation, boundary nodes, and design envelope.</p>
               
            </li>
            
            <li>
               
               <p>The superelement representation inherits the position and orientation of the base FEM representation. The superelement representation must include at least three non-collinear boundary nodes in order to correctly determine the position and orientation. </p>
               
            </li>
            
            <li>
               
               <p>The superelement representation consists only of the reduced boundary nodes and contains no elements. </p>
               
            </li>
            
         </ul>

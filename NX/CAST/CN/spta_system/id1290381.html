         <h2>Solving the system model</h2>
         
         
         <p>When you solve a system model, the software recognizes that the model contains external superelements, and automatically adds the appropriate ASSIGN, SEBULK, SELOC, and SECONCT statements to your bulk data deck to perform a system run. No manual deck editing is required to solve a system model created in Advanced Simulation.</p>

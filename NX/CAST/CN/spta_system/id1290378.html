         <h2>Generating external superelements for Advanced Simulation system models</h2>
         
         <p>To generate superelements, you perform a static condensation (SESTATIC 101 &ndash; Superelement) or component-mode synthesis (SEMODES 103 &ndash; Superelement) reduction. </p>
         
         <p>When you use these superelements in an Advanced Simulation system model, the following considerations apply. </p>
         
         <ul>
            
            <li>
               
               <p>Use NX Nastran 8 or above. Superelements generated by MSC Nastran or earlier versions of NX Nastran are not fully supported for post-processing.</p>
               
            </li>
            
            <li>
               
               <p>Specify DMIGOP2 as the output file format.</p>
               
            </li>
            
            <li>
               
               <p>Request only those results you intend to request for the system run solution.</p>
               
            </li>
            
            <li>
               
               <p>Include at least three non-collinear boundary nodes in order to transform superelement instances with respect to the underlying assembly configuration.</p>
               
            </li>
            
            <li>
               
               <p>Increase the number of boundary nodes and request additional modes to improve accuracy, at the expense of system resources and file size.</p>
               
            </li>
            
         </ul>

         <h2>Replacing a component FEM with a superelement</h2>
         
         <p>To replace a component FEM with its superelement representation, you edit the <span class="uiTerm">FE Model Occurrence Attributes</span> of the component FEM in the context of the assembly FEM. In the <span class="uiTerm">Simulation Navigator</span>, the component icon is bracketed (<span class="literalText">[ ]</span>) to indicate that it is represented by a superelement. 
         </p>
         
         <p></p>
         
         <a name="genid_spta_system_18"></a><div class="figureContainer">
            <table align="center">
               <tr>
                  <td>

                     </div>

               </tr>
            </table>
            <h4>A simple system model in the Simulation Navigator. (1) A component represented by the base FEM. (2) A component represented by a superelement.</h4>
         </div>
         
         
         <p>In the graphics window, the boundary DOF nodes are displayed as unattached markers. You can also display the superelement as either a transparent, lightweight, non-selectable approximation of the base FEM, or a generic superelement symbol. </p>
         
         <p>When you replace the base FEM representation with the superelement representation, the superelement ID (SEID) is displayed in the <span class="uiTerm">FE Model Occurrence Attributes</span> dialog box. You may want to refer to the listed superelement ID when post-processing superelement results or troubleshooting the .f06 file.

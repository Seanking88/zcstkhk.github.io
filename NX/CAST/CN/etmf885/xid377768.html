            <h3>What is it?</h3>
            
            <p>You can now mount tool heads to your machine tool model statically during a CAM session, or dynamically during CSE-based simulation. </p>
            
            <p>You must create heads in NX and submit them to the device library. Simulation requires configuration of the post processor and CSE files.</p>
            
            <p>A working example is provided in your <span class="fileName">...\mach\samples</span> folder. 
            </p>

            <h3>Why should I use it?</h3>
            
            <p>In simulation, you can check if your tool path is correct and detect collisions between heads, other machine components, and the part.</p>

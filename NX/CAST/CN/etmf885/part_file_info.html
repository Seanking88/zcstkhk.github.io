         <h2>Locating the parts</h2>
         <p>The CAST Library parts are, by default, located in the directory shown below, which is established during installation:</p>
         <ul class="unmarkedList">
            <li>
               
               <p>Linux: $UGII_BASE_DIR/nxcast/parts</p>
               
            </li>
            <li>
               
               <p>Windows: %UGII_BASE_DIR%\nxcast\parts</p>
               
            </li>
            <li>
               
               <p>Mac: /Applications/Siemens/NX8.5/nxcast/parts</p>
               
            </li>
         </ul>
         <p>The parts at your facility may be in a different location, depending on how the CAST Library was installed. If you cannot locate the parts, see your system administrator.</p>
         <p>All parts are read-only. If you want to save a copy of a part, use the <span class="uiTerm">Save As</span> command and save the file to a location where you have write access.

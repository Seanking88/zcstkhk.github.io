         <h2>The Custom installation</h2>
         <p>The Custom installation installs CAST on your system and lets you select a custom location for both the HTML source files and the part files.</p>
         <p>You are asked the following questions:</p>
         <ul>
            
            <li>
               
               <p>Will CAST be running from a Web Server or from a UNC Path (Yes/No)?</p>
               
               <ul>
                  
                  <li>
                     
                     <p>If you answer Yes, after you select features to install, you are prompted to enter the URL of the web server running CAST or a UNC path on the network, which is defined by the location where you installed CAST on the feature selection screen.</p>
                     
                     <p>For example: <span class="pathName">http://my.server.com/castnx/html/index.html</span> 
                     </p>
                     
                  </li>
                  
                  <li>
                     
                     <p>If you answer No, the installation continues with the next question.</p>
                     
                  </li>
                  
               </ul>
               
            </li>
            
            <li>
               
               <p>You are shown the feature selection window. On this screen you can define separate installation locations for both the CAST HTML files and the CAST part files.</p>
               
               <ol type="1" start="1">
                  
                  <li>
                     
                     <p>Select to install or not install each of the features using the pull-down selection.</p>
                     
                  </li>
                  
                  <li>
                     
                     <p>If you want to change the default <span class="uiTerm">Install to</span> location, click the <span class="uiTerm">Change</span> button.
                     </p>
                     
                  </li>
                  
               </ol>
               
            </li>
            
         </ul>
         <p>If you are installing CAST HTML files to be run from a Web Server, you should enter a path location somewhere within the folder structure of your web server, for example, <span class="pathName">d:\inetpub\wwwroot\nxcast</span>.
         </p>
         <p>When the installation is complete, a folder named <span class="uiTerm">html</span> is added under the folder you specify for the CAST HTML files and a folder named <span class="uiTerm">parts</span> is added for the CAST part files location.
         </p>
         <p>After you have specified the locations of the HTML and part files, the installation program installs the files in the specified locations.</p>

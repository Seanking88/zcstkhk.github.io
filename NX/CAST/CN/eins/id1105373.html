         <h2>The Network/Web Access installation</h2>
         <p>The Network/Web Access installation requires that CAST has already been installed somewhere on your network. One of the advantages of running a Network/Web Access installation is that only a few very small files are installed on your system. </p>
         <p>Before you run a Network/Web Access installation, you need to know the location of the CAST HTML source files (either a URL on a web server or the full system path) and the location of the CAST part files. </p>
         <p>You are asked the following questions:</p>
         <ul>
            
            <li>
               
               <p>Will CAST be running from a Web Server or from a UNC path (Yes/No)?</p>
               
               <ul>
                  
                  <li>
                     
                     <p>If you answer Yes, you are prompted to enter the URL of the web server running CAST or a UNC path on the network, which is defined by the location where you installed CAST. For example: <span class="pathName">http://my.server.com</span> 
                     </p>
                     
                  </li>
                  
                  <li>
                     
                     <p>If you answer No, you are prompted for the path location of the HTML source folder. For example: <span class="pathName">h:\castnx</span><br/>(The location you select here must contain a folder called <span class="uiTerm">html</span>. For the above example to work, the file <span class="pathName">h:\castnx\html\index.html</span> must exist.)
                     </p>
                     
                     <p>After you have defined the location of the CAST source files, either through a URL or a path name, you are prompted for the location of the part files.</p>
                     
                  </li>
                  
               </ul>
               
            </li>
            
            <li>
               
               <p>Specify the location of the folder that contains the CAST part files folder (this folder must contain a folder named parts).</p>
               
            </li>
            
         </ul>

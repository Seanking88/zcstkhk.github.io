         <h2>Modify CAST startup scripts</h2>
         <p>After you have moved the CAST source files, you must modify the CAST startup script to point to the new location. </p>
         <p>This value should be the URL of the web server that contains the CAST source files, and should point to the <span class="titleReference">index.html</span> file in the CAST source directory. 
         </p>
         <p>This change is made by editing the value of the <span class="literalText">UGII_CAST_HTML_URL</span> environment variable within the <span class="titleReference">castonly</span> script. Follow the instructions below to complete this operation.
         </p>
         <ul>
            
            <li>
               
               <p>Using a text editor, open the following file:</p>
               
               <ul class="unmarkedList">
                  <li>
                     
                     <p>$UGII_BASE_DIR/nxcast/bin/castonly</p>
                     
                  </li>
               </ul>
               
            </li>
            
            <li>
               
               <p>Make the following change to the line that sets the UGII_CAST_SOURCE environment variable:</p>
               
               <ul class="unmarkedList">
                  <li>
                     
                     <p>	:${UGII_CAST_HTML_URL:=http://your.server.com/NX/castnx/index.html}</p>
                     
                  </li>
               </ul>
               
            </li>
            
         </ul>
         <table class="attentionTable attn_note">
            <tr>
               <td valign="top">
                  <p class="attn_title">Note</p>
               </td>
               <td class="attention_main">
                  
                  <p>If you have this environment variable set at the system level, that value would override the setting in this script.</p>
                  
               </td>
            </tr>
         </table>
         <p>Also, in the above example, <span class="pathName">http://your.server.com</span> is the URL address for a web server. This server needs to be up and running before you can run CAST.

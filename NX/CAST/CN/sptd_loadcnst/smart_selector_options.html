         <p>You can use various criteria to determine how and whether different polygonal geometry is related. </p>
         
         <p>For example, these criteria determine the maximum angle between two faces that are considered tangent, or the minimum and maximum radii that determine what is considered a fillet face. You can adjust these criteria depending on your model, or to filter selections when working with complex parts. </p>

            Click <span class="uiTerm">Smart Selector Options</span> <img align="bottom" src="../graphics/graphicLibrary/nx_dss/adv_sim/general_capabilities/selection_techniques/smart_selector.png" border="0"> on the Selection bar to control these criteria.
         </p>
         
         <p>For example, suppose you want to select from a number of cylindrical faces in a part. By specifying the minimum and maximum angle for cylinder and fillet faces, you can more effectively filter the selection to select only the faces you want. </p>

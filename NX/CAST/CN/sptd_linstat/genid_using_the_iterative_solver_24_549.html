            You can turn on the  <span class="uiTerm">Element Iterative Solver</span> option on the  <span class="uiTerm">Solution</span> dialog box, or when you are prompted after you start a solve.

            <li>
               
               <p>Can be faster, uses less memory, and has fewer disk requirements than the standard sparse matrix solver.</p>
               
            </li>
            
            <li>
               
               <p>Can be used for a linear static analysis that does not include contact.</p>

            <li>
               
               <p>Shows the best performance gain with models composed mostly of solid elements. </p>

            <li>
               
               <p>Is very efficient for models composed mostly of parabolic tetrahedral elements. </p>
